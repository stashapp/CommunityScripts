# CommunityScripts Repository

This repository contains plugin and utility scripts created by the Stash community and hosted on the official GitHub repo.  There is also [a list of third-party plugins on our wiki page](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/wiki/Plugins-&--Scripts).

## How To Install
To download a plugin, either clone the git repo, or download the files directly.

It is recommended that plugins are placed in their own subdirectory of your `plugins` directory. The `plugins` directory should be created as a subdirectory in the directory containing your `config.yml` file. This will be in `$HOME/.stash` by default.

When downloading directly click on the file you want and then make sure to click the raw button:
