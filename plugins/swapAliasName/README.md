# Stash Userscripts

## Performer Edit Panel, swap name with alias buttons

Userscript to generate buttons upon clicking will swap the associated alias with the performer name. And mutations to add swap buttons to alias inputs as new aliases are added.

## Use Case

If you have a preferred name for performer but may have content which autotag will not pick up on that name but will an alias. Just click on the button and the name and alias will swap. Save then autotag and repeat the process once autotag is complete to put them back to normal.

Saves having to copy and paste swap the names and aliases manually.

Just be sure to use alias names with Autotag which are quite unique and will not pick up junk content for your performer.

## Will eventually add to my forked repo of the Userscripts Bundle
