# Video Chapter Markers

This plugin extracts chapter information embedded in video files using `ffprobe` and creates markers in Stash. It processes scenes by checking if no markers are present and then adds chapter markers based on the video file's chapter data. This tool is especially useful for automating the import of chapter markers when a scene is updated or processing multiple scenes at once.
