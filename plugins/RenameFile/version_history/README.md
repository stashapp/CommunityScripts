### 0.5.6
- Fixed bug with studio getting the studio ID instead of the name of the studio in rename process.
- Improved performance by having code get all required scene details in one call to stash.
- To remove UI clutter, move rarely used options (performerAppendEnable, studioAppendEnable, tagAppendEnable, & fileRenameViaMove) to renamefile_settings.py
- Change options (performerAppendEnable, studioAppendEnable, tagAppendEnable) to default to True (enabled)
