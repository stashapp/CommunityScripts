        # Example#A2: Task to call a python script. When this task is executed, the keyword <plugin_path> is replaced by filemonitor.py current directory.

        #       Note:   Both seconds and days are also supported for the frequency field. 
        #               However, seconds is mainly used for test purposes.
        #               And days usage is discourage, because it only works if FileMonitor is running for X many days non-stop.
        # The below example tasks are done using hours and minutes, however any of these task types can be converted to a daily, weekly, or monthly syntax.

        {"task" : "PluginId_Here", "taskName" : "Task Name or Plugin Button Name Here", "hours" : 0}, # The zero frequency value makes this task disabled.

        {"task" : "PluginId_Here", "taskName" : "Task Name or Plugin Button Name Here",  "validateDir" : "UsuallySameAsPluginID", "hours" : 0},
        # Example#B3: To run a plugin WITHOUT using the Task Queue, use taskMode instead of taskName and/or add field "taskQue":False. The plugin will run immediately
        {"task" : "PluginId_Here", "taskMode" : "Plugin_Task_MODE",  "taskQue" : False, "hours" : 0}, # Do NOT use taskName when including "taskQue":False 
        # Example#B4: When taskName field is missing, it will always run the task without using the Task Queue. The plugin will run immediately
        {"task" : "PluginId_Here", "hours" : 0},
