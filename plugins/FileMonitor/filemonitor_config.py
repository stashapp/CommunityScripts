    # The task scheduler list.
    # Task can be scheduled to run monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and by minutes. For best results use the scheduler with FileMonitor running as a service.
    # For daily, weekly, and monthly task, use the weekday syntax.
    #   The [Auto Tag] task is an example of a daily scheduled task.
    #   The [Generate] task is an example of a weekly scheduled task.
    #   The [Backup] task is an example of a monthly scheduled task.
    # Note: The hour section in time MUST be a two digit number, and use military time format. Example: 1PM = "13:00" and 1AM = "01:00"

        # The above weekday method is the more reliable method to schedule task, because it doesn't rely on FileMonitor running continuously (non-stop).
        
        # The below examples use frequency field method which can work with minutes and hours. A zero frequency value disables the task.
        #       Note:   Both seconds and days are also supported for the frequency field. 
        #               However, seconds is mainly used for test purposes.
        #               And days usage is discourage, because it only works if FileMonitor is running for X many days non-stop.
        # The below example tasks are done using hours and minutes, however any of these task types can be converted to a daily, weekly, or monthly syntax.
