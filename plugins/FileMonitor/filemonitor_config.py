    # The task scheduler list.
    # Task can be scheduled to run monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, and by minutes. For best results use the scheduler with FileMonitor running as a service.
    # For daily, weekly, and monthly task, use the weekday syntax.
    #   The [Auto Tag] task is an example of a daily scheduled task.
    #   The [Generate] task is an example of a weekly scheduled task.
    #   The [Backup] task is an example of a monthly scheduled task.
    #   The hour section in time MUST be a two digit number, and use military time format. Example: 1PM = "13:00" and 1AM = "01:00"
    # Note: Look at filemonitor_task_examples.py for many example task having more detailed usage.
