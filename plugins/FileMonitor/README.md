# FileMonitor: Ver 1.0.4 (By David Maisonave)

FileMonitor is a [Stash](https://github.com/stashapp/stash) plugin with the following two main features:

- Updates Stash when any file changes occurs in the Stash library.
- **Task Scheduler**: Runs scheduled task based on the scheduler configuration in **filemonitor_config.py**.

## Starting FileMonitor from the UI

From the GUI, FileMonitor can be started as a service or as a plugin. The recommended method is to start it as a service. When started as a service, it will jump on the Task Queue momentarily, and then disappear as it starts running in the background.

- To start monitoring file changes, go to **Stash->Settings->Task->[Plugin Tasks]->FileMonitor**, and click on the [Start Library Monitor Service] button.

  - ![FileMonitorService](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b12aeca9-37a8-447f-90da-26e9440735ad)
  - **Important Note**: At first, it will show up as a plugin in the Task Queue momentarily. It will then disappear from the Task Queue and run in the background as a service.
  - To check running status of FileMonitor, use the Settings->Tools->FileMonitor option.

    - If FileMonitor is running, it'll display the following screen:
    - ![Screenshot 2024-11-29 071836](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28ac9de3-c41a-46cd-8cda-7751fb3e50bb)
  - There's also an icon that gets displayed on the top right corner of the Stash page. When FileMonitor is running this icon has a checkmark on it.
  - ![Screenshot 2024-11-29 073833](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/397615f1-871f-4c1c-ac6e-6b517233e734)
  - When FileMonitor is not running, the icon has an **X**.
  - ![Screenshot 2024-11-29 074154](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8b117fa-9842-40b2-91d4-182c8b4cd528)
  - However, this icon is not very practical, since the user still has to go to the Settings->Tools->FileMonitor page to force it to update the icon.

- To stop FileMonitor click on [Stop Library Monitor] button.
- The **[Monitor as a Plugin]** option is mainly available for backwards compatibility and for test purposes.

## Using FileMonitor as a script

**FileMonitor** can be called as a standalone script.

- To start monitoring call the script and pass --url and the Stash URL.
  - python filemonitor.py --url http://localhost:9999
- To stop **FileMonitor**, pass argument **--stop**.
  - python filemonitor.py **--stop**
  - The stop command works to stop the standalone job and the Stash plugin task job.
- To restart **FileMonitor**, pass argument **--restart**.
  - python filemonitor.py **--restart**
  - The restart command restarts FileMonitor as a Task in Stash.

# Task Scheduler

To enable the scheduler go to **Stash->Settings->Plugins->Plugins->FileMonitor** and enable the **Scheduler** option.
![ReoccurringTaskScheduler](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a7bf6a4-3bd6-4692-a6c3-e9f8f4664f14)

- **Warning:** The below task are already preconfigured in the scheduler, and when the scheduler is enabled all these task are enabled.
  - Auto Tag -> [Auto Tag] (Daily)
  - Maintenance -> [Clean] (every 2 days)
  - Maintenance -> [Clean Generated Files] (every 2 days)
  - Maintenance -> [Optimize Database] (Daily)
  - Generated Content-> [Generate] (Every Sunday at 7AM)
  - Library -> [Scan] (Weekly) (Every Sunday at 3AM)
  - Backup -> [Backup] 2nd Sunday of the month at 1AM
- The example tasks are disabled by default because they either have a zero frequency value or the time field is set to **DISABLED**.

To configure the schedule or to add new task, edit the **task_scheduler** section in the **filemonitor_config.py** file.

```python
"task_scheduler": [
	# To create a daily task, include each day of the week for the weekday field or "every"
	# Optional field for task "Auto Tag" is 'paths'. For detail usage, see example #A3: in filemonitor_task_examples.py

	# The following task runs plugin DupFileManager (tag_duplicates_task) if the plugin is installed. The task runs in the background because of "taskQue" : False
	{"task" : "DupFileManager", "taskMode" : "tag_duplicates_task",  "validateDir" : "DupFileManager",  "taskQue" : False,
				"weekday" : "every",   "time" : "02:30"}, # [Plugin Tasks] -> DupFileManager -> [Delete Duplicates] (Daily at 2:30AM)
	{"task" : "Optimise Database",  "weekday" : "monday,tuesday,wednesday,thursday,friday", "time" : "07:00"},  # Maintenance -> [Optimise Database] (Every weekday at 7AM)

	# The following tasks are scheduled weekly
	# Optional field for task "Scan", "Auto Tag", and "Clean" is 'paths'. For detail usage, see examples #A3: in filemonitor_task_examples.py
	{"task" : "Scan",                   "weekday" : "saturday",   "time" : "03:00"}, # Library -> [Scan] (Weekly) (Every saturday at 3AM)
	{"task" : "Auto Tag",               "weekday" : "saturday",   "time" : "03:30"}, # Auto Tag -> [Auto Tag] (Weekly) (Every saturday at 3:30AM)

	{"task" : "Optimise Database",      "weekday" : "saturday",   "time" : "05:30"}, # Maintenance -> [Optimise Database] (Every saturday at 5:30AM)

	# To perform a task monthly, specify the day of the month as in the weekly schedule format, and add a monthly field.
		# The monthly field value must be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
			# 1 = 1st specified weekday of the month. Example 1st monday.
			# 2 = 2nd specified weekday of the month. Example 2nd monday of the month.
			# 3 = 3rd specified weekday of the month.
			# 4 = 4th specified weekday of the month.
	# The Backup task is scheduled monthly
	# Optional field for task "Backup" is maxBackup. For detail usage, see example #A5 in filemonitor_task_examples.py
	{"task" : "Backup",                 "weekday" : "sunday",  "time" : "01:00", "monthly" : 2}, # Backup -> [Backup] 2nd sunday of the month at 1AM (01:00)

	{"task" : "DupFileManager", "taskName" : "Delete Duplicates",  "validateDir" : "DupFileManager",
										"weekday" : "sunday",  "time" : "02:00", "monthly" : 2}, # [Plugin Tasks] -> DupFileManager -> [Delete Duplicates] 2nd sunday of the month at 2AM (02:00)

	# The [CheckStashIsRunning] task checks if Stash is running. If not running, it will start up stash.
	# This task only works if FileMonitor is started as a service or in command line mode.
	# Optional fields are 'command' and 'RunAfter'. For detail usage, see examples #C1 and #C2 in filemonitor_task_examples.py
	{"task" : "CheckStashIsRunning",    "minutes" :5}, # Checks every 5 minutes
],
```

- To add plugins to the task list, use the Plugin-ID in the "task" field. The plugin ID is usually the file name of the script without the extension.
  - Plugin task have the following optional fields: taskName, taskMode, validateDir, and taskQue
    - The **validateDir** field can be used to define the plugin sub directory, which is checked to see if it exist before running the task.
    - **taskName** field is used to name the task to call for the associated plugin. It can not be used with "taskQue":False
    - **taskQue** field is used to call the plugin without using the Task Queue. I.E. "taskQue":False. When this field is set to False, the taskName field can NOT be used. Instead use taskMode to identify the task to call.
    - **taskMode** field is used in order to run the plugin without using the Task Queue. The plugin runs immediately. Be careful not to confuse taskMode with taskName. Look in the plugin \*.yml file under the **tasks** section where it defines both the task-name and the task-mode.
- Task can be scheduled to run monthly, weekly, hourly, and by minutes.
- The scheduler list uses two types of syntax. One is **weekday** based, and the other is **frequency** based.

  - **weekday Based**

    - Use the weekday based syntax for daily, weekly, and monthly schedules.
    - All the weekday based methods must have a **weekday** field and a **time** field, which specifies the day(s) of the week and the time to start the task.
    - **Daily**:
      - A daily task populates the weekday field with all the days of the week or with keyword **every**.
      - **Daily Example**:
        - Starts a task daily at 6AM.
          - `{"task" : "Optimise Database",   "weekday" : "monday,tuesday,wednesday,thursday,friday,saturday,sunday",   "time" : "06:00"},`
        - Starts a task daily at 2PM.
          - `{"task" : "Optimise Database",   "weekday" : "every",   "time" : "14:00"},`
    - **Weekly**:
      - **Weekly Example**:
        - Starts a task weekly every monday and 9AM.
          - `{"task" : "Generate",   "weekday" : "monday",   "time" : "09:00"},`
    - **Monthly**:
      - The monthly syntax is similar to the weekly format, but it also includes a **"monthly"** field which must be set to 1, 2, 3, or 4.
      - **Monthly Examples**:
        - Starts a task once a month on the 3rd sunday of the month and at 1AM.
          - `{"task" : "Backup",     "weekday" : "sunday",   "time" : "01:00", "monthly" : 3},`
        - Starts a task at 2PM once a month on the 1st saturday of the month.
          - `{"task" : "Clean",     "weekday" : "saturday",   "time" : "14:00", "monthly" : 1},`

  - **Frequency Based**
    - The frequency field can be in **minutes** or **hours**.
    - The frequency value must be a number greater than zero. A frequency value of zero will disable the task on the schedule.
    - **Frequency Based Examples**:
      - Starts a task every 24 hours.
        - `{"task" : "Auto Tag",   "hours" : 24},`
      - Starts a (**plugin**) task every 30 minutes.
        - `{"task" : "Create Tags", "pluginId" : "pathParser", "minutes" : 30},`
    - The frequency field does support **days** and **seconds**.
      - **seconds** is mainly used for test purposes.
      - The use of **days** is discourage, because it only works if FileMonitor is running for X many days non-stop.
        - For example, if days is used with 30 days, FileMonitor would have to be running non-stop for 30 days before the task is activated. If it's restarted at any time during the 30 days, the count down restarts.
        - It's recommended to use weekday based syntax over using days, because many restarts can occur during the week or month, and the task will still get started as long as FileMonitor is running during the scheduled activation time.

- The scheduler feature requires `pip install schedule`
  - If the user leaves the scheduler disabled, **schedule** does NOT have to be installed.
- For best results use the scheduler with FileMonitor running as a service.

## Requirements

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Or manually install each requirement:
  - `pip install stashapp-tools --upgrade`
  - `pip install requests`
  - `pip install watchdog`
  - `pip install schedule`
  - `pip install pyyaml`

Note: pyyaml is only needed for a Docker setup.

## Installation

- Follow **Requirements** instructions.
- In the stash plugin directory (C:\Users\MyUserName\.stash\plugins), create a folder named **FileMonitor**.
- Copy all the plugin files to this folder.(**C:\Users\MyUserName\\.stash\plugins\FileMonitor**).
- Click the **[Reload Plugins]** button in Stash->Settings->Plugins->Plugins.

That's it!!!

## Options

- Main options are accessible in the GUI via Settings->Plugins->Plugins->[FileMonitor].
  - When the UI option [Max DB Backups] is set to a value greater than 1, and when the scheduler is enabled, the quantity of database backup files are trim down to the set [**Max DB Backups**] value after the scheduler executes the Backup task.
  - The other options are self explanatory from the UI.
- Additional options available in filemonitor_config.py. The options are well documented in the commented code.

## Docker

### Single Stash Docker Installation

**Note:** This section is for users who have a single instance of Stash Docker installed, and do NOT have Stash installed on the host machine.

- FileMonitor requires watchdog module in order to work. Although the watchdog module loads and runs on Docker, it fails to function because Docker fails to report file changes.
- FileMonitor can work with Docker Stash setup if it's executed externally on the host OS. To do this, start FileMonitor on the command line and pass the Stash URL and docker YML file. (**--url** and **--docker**)
- Example1:

```
python filemonitor.py --url http://localhost:9999 --docker "C:\Users\MyUser\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl\Stash27.2\docker-compose.yml"
```

- Example2: (with ApiKey)
  - If Stash Docker is configured with a password, an ApiKey is needed, and has to be passed on the command line (**--apikey**).

```
python filemonitor.py --url http://localhost:9999 --docker "C:\Users\MyUser\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl\Stash27.2\docker-compose.yml" --apikey "zNDU0MDk3N30.4nZVLk3xikjJZfZ0JTPA_Fic8JveycCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1aWQiOiJheHRlJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5I6IkFQSUtleSIsImlhdCI6MTcFx3DZe5U21ZDcC3c"
```

- The **docker-compose.yml** file should be located in the folder associated with the Docker Stash container, and it list the mapped paths which FileMonitor uses to determine the host path which is mapped to the Docker path.
- For more information, see [Using FileMonitor as a script](https://github.com/David-Maisonave/Axter-Stash/tree/main/plugins/FileMonitor#Using-FileMonitor-as-a-script)
- For more information on creating a Docker Stash setup, see (https://github.com/David-Maisonave/Axter-Stash/tree/main/Docker)

### Multiple Stash Docker Configuration

**Note:** This section applies to users who have multiple Stash Docker instances running, and also have Stash installed and running on the host machine.

- FileMonitor can be configured to run on the host machine, and update all the Stash Docker instances when an associated file change occurs. To activate this option change the filemonitor_config.py file by setting the **dockers** field with the information associated with each Stash Docker instance.
- There are three examples that are commented out in the **dockers** field, which users can easily modify to configure for their particular Stash Docker instances.
- The following is the uncommented example from the **filemonitor_config.py** file.

```Python
    # Docker notification from host machine
    "dockers": [
        # A simple basic example with only one bind mount path.
        {"GQL":"http://localhost:9995", "apiKey":"", "bindMounts":[{r"C:\Video":"/mnt/Video"}]},

        # Example having 8 bind mount paths.
        {"GQL":"http://localhost:9997", "apiKey":"", "bindMounts":[
                {r"C:\Users\admin3\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl\ManyMnt\data":"/data"},
                {r"C:\Users\admin3\Videos":"/external"},
                {r"C:\Users\admin3\Pictures":"/external2"},
                {r"C:\Users\admin3\Downloads":"/external3"},
                {r"E:\Downloads":"/external4"},
                {r"E:\Celeb":"/external5"},
                {r"F:\Hentai":"/external6"},
                {r"Z:\Temp":"/external7"},
            ]
        },

        # Example using the apiKey for a password configured Stash installation.
        {"GQL":"http://localhost:9994", "apiKey":"eyJhb3676zgdUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IwfXVCJ9.ewJ1aWQiOiJheHRlweIsInN1YiI6IkFQSUtleSIsImlhdewrweczNDU0MDk3N30.4nZVLk3xikjJZfZ0JTPA_Fic8JvFx3DZe5U21Zasdag", "bindMounts":[
                {r"C:\Users\admin3\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl\MyStashContainer\data":"/data"},
                {r"C:\Vid":"/mnt/Vid"},
                {r"C:\Users\admin3\Downloads":"/mnt/Downloads"},
            ]
        },
    ],
```

- Each Stash Docker instance requires three fields, which are case sensitive.
  - **GQL**: This is the Stash URL which is used by the host machine to access the particular Stash Docker instance. Note: Do **NOT** include graphql in the URL.
  - **apiKey**: This is a required field, but the value can be empty if the Stash instances doesn't require a password.
  - **bindMounts**: At least one bind mount path must be specified.
    - The first string defines the host path (**C:\Video**), and the second string defines the Docker mount path (**/mnt/Video**). These paths are listed on Docker-Desktop under Containers->ContainerName->[Bind Mounts] tab.
      - The host path must be a fully qualified host local path. It can **not** be a relative path **(./../Videos)** and it can **not** be a URL with a local network domain name **(\\\\MyComputerName\\SharedPath\\MyFolder)**.
      - If the host path contains a backslash, start the string with an r. Example: **r"C:\Vid"**
    - If any of the below mount paths are included, they will be ignored because they could trigger a feedback loop.
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - ./config:/root/.stash
      - ./metadata:/metadata
      - ./cache:/cache
      - ./blobs:/blobs
      - ./generated:/generated
