# DupFileManager: Ver 1.0.0 (By David Maisonave)

DupFileManager is a [Stash](https://github.com/stashapp/stash) plugin which manages duplicate files in the Stash system.
It has both **task** and **tools-UI** components.

### Features

- Creates a duplicate file report which can be accessed from the settings->tools menu options.The report is created as an HTML file and stored in local path under plugins\DupFileManager\report\DuplicateTagScenes.html.
  - See screenshot at the bottom of this page for example report.
  - Items on the left side of the report are the primary duplicates designated for deletion. By default, these duplicates are given a special \_duplicate tag.
  - Items on the right side of the report are designated as primary duplicates to keep. They usually have higher resolution, duration and/or preferred paths.
  - The report has the following options:
    - Delete: Delete file and remove from Stash library.
    - Remove: Remove from Stash library.
    - Rename: Rename file.
    - Copy: Copy file from left (source) to right (to-keep).
    - Move: Copy file and metadata left to right.
    - Cpy-Name: Copy file name left to right.
    - Add-Exclude: Add exclude tag to scene,so that scene is excluded from deletion.
    - Remove-Tag: Remove duplicate tag from scene.
    - Flag-Scene: Flag (mark) scene in report as reviewed (or as requiring further review). Optional flags (yellow, green, orange, cyan, pink, red, strike-through, & disable-scene)
    - Merge: Copy Metadata (tags, performers,& studios) from left to right.
- Can merge potential source in the duplicate file names for tag names, performers, and studios.
  - Normally when Stash searches the file name for tag names, performers, and studios, it only does so using the primary file.
- Advance menu (for specially tagged duplicates)
