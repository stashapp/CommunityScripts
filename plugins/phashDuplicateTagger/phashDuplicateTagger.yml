# This plugin has four functions:
#
# 1) It will create two tags for review, [Dupe: Keep] and [Dupe: Remove]
# 2) It will auto assign those tags to scenes with different degrees of matching PHashes based on (and in this order):
#       a) Keep the larger resolution
#       b) Keep the larger file size (if same resolution)
#       c) Keep the older scene (if same file size.)
#           (Older scene is kept since it's more likely to have been organized if they're the same file)
#    With this order of precedence one scene is determined to be the "Keeper" and the rest are assigned for Removal
#    When the scenes are tagged, the titles are also modified to add '[Dupe: {SceneID}K/R]'
#    The SceneID put into the title is the one determined to be the "Keeper", and is put into all matching scenes
#    This way you can sort by title after matching and verify the scenes are actually the same thing, and the Keeper
#    will be the first scene in the set. (Since you'll have [Dupe: 72412K], [Dupe: 72412R], [Dupe: 72412R] as an example
#
# 3) It will remove the [Dupe: Keep] and [Dupe: Remove] tags from Stash
# 4) It will remove the [Dupe: ######K/R] tags from the titles
#   (These last two options are obviously for after you have removed the scenes you don't want any longer)
#
# PS. This script is essentially a hack and slash job on scripts from Belley and WithoutPants, thanks guys!
