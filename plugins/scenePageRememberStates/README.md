# Scene Page Remember States

https://discourse.stashapp.cc/t/scene-page-remember-states/1389

This plugin uses local storage to rememebr what is the current active nav tab of the scenes' detail panel, and upon any page load activate the last remembered active nav tab.

It also rembers the active collapsed state of the divider button and upon page load if it's true, it will automatically collapse the divider.
