# e621 tagger

Just a quick script to tag your uploadings

Took some code from bulkImageScrape as example, because I'm not a python dev

https://github.com/stashapp/CommunityScripts/blob/main/plugins/bulkImageScrape/bulkImageScrape.py

## How to use

Go to Tasks -> e621_tagger -> Press Tag Everything

## Configuration

You can configure which tags it will skip. By default, it will skip `e621_tagged` tag

## Rate limit

Be aware, that e621 has rate limit. In script it's hardcoded 2 seconds on wait time
